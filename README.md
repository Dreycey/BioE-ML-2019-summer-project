## Goals for the Summer 2019 project

### (1) Implement a machine learning algorithm

The goal here is to get a working algorithm for solving the image processing task at hand. The goal isn't to out compete all of the existing entries per se, but to have a machine learning project for the club to work on over the summer. 

### (2) Complete all of the tasks laid out by the team

#### TASK #1

#### TASK #2
